# ViewModelSupport

This is not an MVVM framework. It is just the base class I use to reduce the friction when writing ViewModels. Making it public to share my ideas.

This ViewModel base class is fully documented in this blog post: [Adventures in MVVM -- My ViewModel Base](http://houseofbilz.com/archive/2010/05/08/adventures-in-mvvm-ndash-my-viewmodel-base.aspx)

The ViewModelLocator is documented in this blog post: [Adventures in MVVM -- ViewModel Location and Creation](http://www.houseofbilz.com/archive/2010/06/04/adventures-in-mvvm-ndash-viewmodel-location-and-creation.aspx)
